# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project
This project is a machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. Using a dataset of clinical features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, the model applies classification algorithms to identify risk levels.

## Key Features:

Utilized popular machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
Performed feature selection and data preprocessing to improve model accuracy.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Created visualizations to present insights and feature importance.

## Technologies Used:
  - Python
  - Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Purpose:
To develop a predictive system to assist medical professionals and raise awareness about early detection of heart disease.
